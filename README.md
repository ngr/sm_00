"Slave Center"
==

"Slave Center" is a MMO Economics Strategy with players represented by Slave Masters in the game. They own some territory and slaves to operate with. This can be played both as "Tamagotchi" just for fun, or as a serious microeconomics emulation if you feel you can affect the game world after some time.
