"Slave Master"
==
This document describes the idea of the game.
"Slave Master" is a temporary name. In case the game would ever be launched there is a great law and ethics research required to fix all the possible infringements.

The idea is to create a single/multiplayer online game with an idea of mastering slaves. This is an infinite business strategy not an "adult" game. Still there is violence possible. The player may choose his business type and get some initial slaves to develop.
